# flask-forum

## Introduction

A simple forum build with flask. It's still a work in progress...

## Roadmap

Here I will outline a few key features I am planning to add.

- Better UI/UX
- Encrypted Auth

## Installation

You'll need to have a firebase account and set up a new project with firebase-admin.

```
pip install flask python-firebase

export FLASK_APP=main.py

flask run
```
